##### **Description**:
Discord Mute Yourself is a Python-based project designed to enhance your Discord experience by automatically muting users in a voice channel when specific keywords are detected. Whether it's you or others in the channel saying phrases like "mute" or "[name] mute yourself," this python code will ensure the user is muted instantly. This tool is perfect for streamers, moderators, or anyone who wants to maintain a controlled environment in their Discord voice channels.

Inspired by the need for automated voice channel moderation on Discord.
